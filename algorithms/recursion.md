# Recursion

## Recursion Links

- [Dijkstra was right - recursion should not be difficult](https://indepth.dev/dijkstra-was-right-recursion-should-not-be-difficult/) has a good overview of Recursion.
- [Recursion made simple](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/32873/Recursion-made-simple)
- [Iteration vs Recursion](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21194/Iterative-vs-Recursive-Approaches) gives a good overview of the efficiency comparison between recursion, iteration, and an optimized recursion where the values are stored in a Dictionary. The optimized recursion could be made even more efficient using tail recursion, though for things like the Fibonacci numbers & factorial the iterative solution is going to be more efficient if for no other reason than it doesn't make additional method calls.

## Implementing Recursion

From DonaldPShimodap, Hacker News:

1. Write down what your function does in a comment.  (e.g., "sum all the elements of a binary tree").
2. Write the function signature.
3. Write the base case. (This is usually straightforward.)
4. Stop thinking.
5. Assume your function already works and write the recursive case.
6. Profit!

## Applications of Recursion

- [Recursive drawing](http://recursivedrawing.com/) lets you make interesting recursive drawings
- This article about [recursive data structures](http://raganwald.com/2016/12/27/recursive-data-structures.html) starts with an interesting application of recursion to rotate images.

## Recursion Humor

To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
