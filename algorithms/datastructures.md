# Data Structures

## Links to other classes

- [CSC310 at SDSU](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk) covers a lot of the same data structures & sorting material as we do in CSC205 but at a more indepth level

## Collections & Generics

- Oracle's Java tutorial on [Interfaces & collections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html)
- [ArrayList documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) (you don't have to memorize this, but you should at least be aware of the types of methods the class allows)
- [Autoboxing](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/autoboxing.html) is something you should be aware of when adding primitive types such as int and float to collections

## General Data Structures

- The [NIST Dictionary of Algorithms & Data Structures](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/)
- A good series of [short lectures about Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk)

## Linked Lists

## Stacks

- The [Stack in Magic & JavaScript](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-stack-in-magic-and-javascript-47229c148990) has some good analogies for the stack.  You don't need to know JavaScript to understand the main points.

## Queues

## Trees

- [Where are all the search trees?](https://lemire.me/blog/2015/10/13/where-are-all-the-search-trees/) discusses how search trees are not always the best solution and how hash maps sometimes are sufficient.
- A video introduction to [Tree & Heap terminology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHZu1GV27tI&list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk&index=47)

## Decision Trees

[Visualizing Decision Trees](https://explained.ai/decision-tree-viz/index.html) talks about how decision trees are used in machine learning and describes a way to generate a nice graphical representation of them.

## B-trees

A paper about [modern use of B-trees]([http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.7269&rep=rep1&type=pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20160917171253/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.219.7269&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  This goes into way more detail than what you need for this course, but if you are interested in how databases work under the hood you should fine this helpful.

## Heaps

This [website](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/JavascriptVisual/Heap.html) lets you visualize what happens when you add integers to an array-based heap

## Graphs

- An [illustrated introduction to graph theory with applications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/i-dont-understand-graph-theory-1c96572a1401/)
- A 7-hour [course on Graph Theory](https://youtu.be/09_LlHjoEiY)
- [D3 Graph Theory](https://d3gt.com/index.html) - A very nice interactive introduction to Graph theory.
- [Understanding Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://blog.aos.sh/2018/02/24/understanding-dijkstras-algorithm/) goes over Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm
- Examples of how [graphs are used in Machine Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-graph-algorithms-improve-machine-learning)
- [Markov chains](https://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/) are one application of directed graphs
- A graph showing the [Lexical Distance Among the Languages of Europe](https://elms.wpcomstaging.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/)
- Wolfram Alpha has some interesting [graph & network capabilities](https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/graphs-and-networks/)

### Real-world Applications of Graphs

- Google uses graph theory to find [routes for electric vehicles](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252261/google-maps-electric-vehicle-charging-station-ai)
- [Math reveals unseen worlds of Star Wars](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/math-reveals-unseen-worlds-of-star-wars/)
- [The Wizarding World of Harry Poter](http://dpmartin42.github.io/projects/Harry_Potter/Harry_Potter_Network.html) displays a graph of character relationships in the Harry Potter universe.
