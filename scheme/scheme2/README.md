# Scheme Module2

You must understand recursion for this module.  The two videos below go over how recursion works & tail recursion.

[Video](https://youtu.be/a8tulokZSk8) (14:54): *Introduction to writing list procedures in Scheme*

This video introduces writing recursive list procedures in Scheme, including a method that does nothing but go through a list (leaving it alone) to demonstrate the general structure of a recursive list procedure.  The video also walks through the `rember` procedure from *The Little Schemer* that removes the first occurence of an element, a procedure to remove non-numeric values from a list, the procedure `lat?` from *The Little Schemer* that checks that all elements of a list are atoms, and finally a `member?` predicate.

## listprocedures2.scm

[Video](https://youtu.be/9PninqTenfU) (11:34): *List procedures that combine the elements of a list*

Examples include summing the elements of a list, doubling each element of a list, summing the double of each element in the list, and adding two lists together in a pairwise fashion.

## listprocedures3.scm

[Video](https://youtu.be/2JkRNjOmbRs) (7:37): *Additional examples of writing recursive list procedures in Scheme*

This video features examples of writing a procedure recursively generating a list and of writing procedures that return a modified version of the list.  

## listprocedures4.scm

[Video](https://youtu.be/Y7NQD9hABfI) (6:26): *Even more examples of writing recursive list procedures in Scheme*

This video features examples of writing a procedure that combines the elements of a list, searching lists, and working with nested lists (lists that contain other lists).

## pairs.scm

[Video](https://youtu.be/lML7RaSldkI) (15:16): *Introduction to Scheme pairs*

Includes difference between pairs & lists, using pairs, and writing functions that work with pairs
