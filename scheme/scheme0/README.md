# Scheme Module 0

We will be using DrRacket as our Scheme IDE/REPL.  DrRacket comes with the Racket download.  The first set of videos go over installing Racket then remaining videos go over using DrRacket.  There is some overlap with the videos to reinforce the key points.

This video goes over setting Scheme as the default language in Scheme so that you don't have to type `#lang scheme` manually in every file.  We also go over some Scheme basics, including literals, writing a function, and defining names.
