# Programming Languages & Paradigms

## CSC240 Module 1 - Introduction to Programming Languages & Paradigms

- [VIDEO: Programming Language Paradigms](https://youtu.be/dBiPRIfi4uE) (10:31) is an introduction to the course and a high level overview of programming paradigms
- [VIDEO: Programming Language History](https://youtu.be/MzwnYGgTX4Y) (9:19) reviews the how & why of programming language evolution
- [VIDEO: Compilation & Interpretation](https://youtu.be/kyjRqcP4DkM) (8:10) goes over the various techniques for getting source code to execute
- [VIDEO: Characteristics of Programming Languages](https://youtu.be/Urqf4QOsOQM) (14:50) goes over some important concepts relating to programming languages, including syntax, semantics, data types, type checking, type conversion, & orthogonality

## Programming Language Usage Trends

Some of these are a bit out of date, but they each have some interesting information about how language use evolves over time.

- The [TIOBE Index](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index//?imm_mid=0deb02&cmp=em-prog-na-na-newsltr_20160109) shows languages that are rising and falling in popularity (though not necessarily in usage).
- [The Rise and Fall of Programming Languages in 2013](http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/the-rise-and-fall-of-languages-in-2013/240165192) is an interesting snapshot.  Unfortunately drdobs.com is no longer publishing so there is no updated information.
- [The Redmonk Language Ranking](https://redmonk.com/sogrady/2020/02/28/language-rankings-1-20/) comes out a couple of times a year and plots languages based on their frequency in Stack Overflow discussions and GitHub projects.  There is bias towards languages with lots of beginners and open source projects, but there are some interesting data points.

## Aspects of Programming Languages

### Readability

- [What does **code readability** really mean?](http://typicalprogrammer.com/what-does-code-readability-mean)

## Programming Language Paradigms

Specific information about the paradigms covered in CSC240 on the page for those languages (C, C++, Scheme, & Prolog).

### General Articles and Papers About Programming Language Paradigms

- [Questions to ask when choosing a programming language](https://shekhargulati.com/2021/02/12/questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-programming-language/) and some of the answers from companies
- A [review](https://blog.acolyer.org/2018/01/29/the-paradigms-of-programming/) of an old paper on programming paradigms
- A [taxonomy of programming language paradigms](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigms.html)

### Articles and Papers about Specific Programming Language Paradigms

- A short [introduction to the Actor Model](https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/)

## Coding Style

- If you wonder why I always use braces, even for a single line block, the risk of introducing bugs like what is described in [this article about Apple's SSL/TLS bug from 2014](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html) is why.  You may also find it interesting to see a "goto" used in real code.
- In some languages, [adding spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP#Spaces) can completely change the meaning of a statement

## Learning Other Languages

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) has a ton of quick introductions to several different programming languages
- [Coding Ground](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) has several different browser-based compilers you use to try out several languages.  Note that while this is great for trying things out, try not to rely on these.  For class projects you will want to use the recommended compiler for that class.

## Example Code

- A great way to learn a new language is to look at good examples.  Here is a [curated list of projects with good code](https://github.com/CodeReaderMe/awesome-code-reading)
- Many languages are developed on GitHub, so you can see real world examples of compiler code, often written in C & C++.  Here's [a list](https://github.com/showcases/programming-languages)
- The [source code for Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) (written in C)

## Programming Language History

You will notice that I talk a lot about the history of programming languages.  While you may never actually code professionally in an old language, there are still ideas from the past that you can apply even in modern languages.

- The [oldest programming languages still in use](https://www.oldest.org/technology/programming-languages/)
- Bret Victor’s talk [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4) discusses some “futuristic” ideas with programming languages from the perspective of someone in the 1970s.
- “Uncle” Bob Martin on [The Future of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc) gives an overview of the history of programming and talks about where it is headed.
- [Plugboard Programming](http://www.righto.com/2017/04/1950s-tax-preparation-plugboard.html) on the IBM 403 Accounting Machine
