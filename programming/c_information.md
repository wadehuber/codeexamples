# C

## Compiling C with gcc

We will be using [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for CSC240.  Always compile your code using the following command line options to ensure you are writing standard C code:

```bash
gcc --std=c11 -pedantic -Wall filename.c
```

then to run the code in Ubuntu, other Linux distros, WSL, or MacOS

```bash
./a.out
```

or under Cygwin

```bash
./a.exe
```

Not using gcc with these compile flags may hide errors that result in a grade of 0 on your project!
Also, you should use gcc version 4.7 or later.  Earlier versions may be missing some features you will need for this class.

### More gcc flags

The flags above are required, bug gcc has a lot of other flags you may want to use to help you find potential bugs in your code.

- [Recommended gcc flags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/154630/recommended-gcc-warning-options-for-c?noredirect=1&lq=1) on Stack Overflow
- This [blog post](https://kristerw.blogspot.com/2017/09/useful-gcc-warning-options-not-enabled.html) mentions some other warning flags you may want to enable to help you avoid common mistakes (applies to gcc & g++).

## Advanced C Tutorials/Examples

The links below go far more in depth into C than we will in this class, but if you are interested in C you may find them interesting.

- [Inside the C Standard Library](https://begriffs.com/posts/2019-01-19-inside-c-standard-lib.html)
- I don’t have strong opinions about coding style, other than your code should be clear & consistently formatted.  But you may want to review the [Linux coding standards](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
- A list of [obscure C features](https://multun.net/obscure-c-features.html)(that you should probably avoid, but you may see out in the wild)
- [Back to Basics](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/12/11/back-to-basics/) discusses how C strings and malloc work and why it is important to know it.
- [Signal handling](https://publications.gbdirect.co.uk//c_book/chapter9/signal_handling.html) in C

## Static Analysis

See the [C++ Information page](./cpp_information.md) for information about `cppcheck` which is the static analyzer I'll be using on your C & C++ assignments.

- [Splint](http://splint.org/) is a static analyzer for security vulnerabilities and general coding issues

## Memory Usage & Data Alignment

- [Recursion, Run time Environment, & the Call Stack](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~efif/courses/Software1_Summer_04/lectures/lecture7_2.php) shows how function calls work in C
- Some lecture notes about [how C uses memory](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj/cs360/360/notes/Memory/lecture.html)(Unix oriented, but the first section is applicable anywhere)
- We will talk in class about how C structs sometime waste space due to word alignment.  [The Lost Art of Structure Packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/?src=yc) is a good article about how rearranging your structs can wind up saving a lot of space in your program.  There are a few things we probably won't cover about in the article, but you should know enough C by the end to understand most of it.
- A [bug report](http://pzemtsov.github.io/2016/11/06/bug-story-alignment-on-x86.html) related to how data is aligned in memory

## Macros and Multi-file Programs

- There is some good files & the pre-processor in the [GNU libc manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Header-Files.html) and the [gcc manual](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Header-Files.html#Header-Files)
- To prevent a file from being included multiple times in the same program, we add

```C
#ifndef __PERSONNEL_H__
#define __PERSONNEL_H
```

to the beginning of the file and

```C
#endif
```

to the end of the file.

## ANSI C vs C11

For Loops: In ANSI C (C89) you cannot declare the loop variable in the for loop - you have to declare it before the for statement like this:

```C
int ii;
for (ii=0;ii<10;ii++) {
  /* loop stuff */
}
```

 NOT like this:

```C
for (int ii=0;ii<10;ii++) {
  /* loop stuff */
}
```

## Object-Oriented Programming with C

[Axel-Tobias Schreiner](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/) has written a book on *Object Oriented Programming in C* (available for download under the "books" link).  The book touches on some advanced topics we will likely not have time for this semester, but it is interesting if only for the fact that there is no "++" at the end of the book title.  While we will discuss many programming language paradigms CSC240, it is important to keep in mind that you can take the techniques from any paradigm and apply them to your language of choice.
