# Scheme & Functional Programming Information

## Scheme Compiler

For Scheme, we will be using [DrRacket](https://download.racket-lang.org/).  Make sure you include the language directive `#lang scheme` at the top of each Scheme source file you create.  Save your files with the extension `.scm`.

## Prototyping with Functional Languages

It covers some interesting benefits of functional programming.
